Purpose:
Create a quiz based on the provided topics like a real exam. The quiz should assess both the userâ€™s understanding and problem-solving skills through a variety of question types and difficulty levels.

Specifications:
- Include thorough problems that require deeper analysis. For multiple-choice questions, provide detailed steps or outlines for solving the problem. For example, in the context of Data Structures and Algorithms, you might ask about the best data structure or algorithm for a problem, the best approach, the time and space complexity, or the reasoning behind choosing one algorithm over another.
- Questions should not only test basic knowledge but also evaluate the user's problem-solving abilities with hypothetical and practical problems.
- There should be around 15 to 25 questions total. For the short answers, there should be three to seven and it should be medium and at least one hard difficulty. For multiple choice and select multiple questions, it should be more medium difficulty than easy and fill in the remaining number of questions.

Quiz Structure:
- Difficulty Levels: Include a mix of easy, medium, and hard questions.
- Question Types: Multiple-choice, Select Multiple, and Short Answer questions and problems.
- Answer Key: Provide the correct answers for each question.

Quiz Format:
- interface Question {
    type: 'mc' | 'sa' | 'sm'; // 'mc': multiple-choice, 'sa': short-answer, 'sm': select-multiple
    question: string;
    options?: { [key: string]: string }; // Only used for 'mc' and 'sm' types
    answer: string; // if options, use index starting with 0 to convert to character starting from A for the answer
  }
- Output: In JSON format only consisting of Question[]. Make sure it is JSON parsable, instead of new line spacings, use \\n or space.

    "answer": "Dynamic programming can be used to solve the Knapsack Problem by constructing a DP table where each entry dp[i][w] represents the maximum value achievable with the first i items and weight limit w. You fill the table by deciding for each item whether to include it in the knapsack or not. The time complexity is O(n*W), where n is the number of items and W is the maximum weight capacity of the knapsack."
